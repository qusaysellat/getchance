This website will allow the people, companies and universities to register themselves with detailed information added. People can add their experience and education information in a verified way (confirmation of respected companies and universities required), and after that, an auto-generated CV will be updated on peoplesâ€™ profile pages. Also, users will be able to share ideas and opportunities through posts which will be interactive.
This website front-end is yet to be well-designed. However, a simple front-end is used to explain main functionalities.
